# Portfolio - Ã‰cole 42 - Paris / Silicon-Valley

Projects made ate School 42, a learning school with no teacher.

Silicon Valley (
https://www.42.us.org/)
Paris (http://http://www.42.fr/)

42 is a computer educational center, the pedagogy is peer-to-peer learning : a participative process that allows students to unleash their creativity through project-based learning. The establishment was founded by Florian Bucher, Xavier Niel, Nicolas Sadirac and Kwame Yamgnane in 2013 while the digital industry is in full lack of IT developers in France. To train many of the best talents of tomorrow, the school provides the best infrastructure in a unique and modern place. 42, this is our answer to what should be the school of tomorrow.

Situated in the Bay Area USA and Paris France.

# About the projects

Almost all projects are coded in **C language** on **macOS**.
All the projects are coded following a strict coding guideline (norm):

**A few norm highlights:**
* You can only use While loops
* max 84 characters per line
* max 25 lines per function
* max 4 arguments per function
* incredibly specific tabulation
* declarations and instantiations must be separate
* no memory leaks, no segmentation faults, no exceptions
* most importantly, **no use of C Standard Library functions** besides **(write, malloc, free, open, read)**, unless otherwise specified

# Projects made

These are the projects that I have completed during my time spent at 42, from April 2018 - until now.
There are repositories containing projects.

## Introduction

### C Piscine
1 month intensive selection program called the Piscine (French word for swimming pool), students that was selected bt an online test go to school and spend this 1 month where only the most rigorous and tenacious students are selected to enter the main program. The content is an introduction to Unix, C programming language and simple data structures.

([C Piscine Repository] Need to add on git)

### Libft
First project after starting the main program. We code **our own C library** that we will use for following projects besides of using the C Standard Library, to use for the rest of our projects. As we progress in the curriculum, new functions are constantly added to our personal libraries.

### Fillit
The goal of fillit is to implement a very specific algorithm that packs a list of teris tetrominoes (input) into the smallest square possible. Due to the nature of the rules, the only real solution is done through recursive backtracking.

### Get Next Line
Recode getline from the C Standard Library. A true test of rigor.

## DevOps Branch

### Init
This project has the goal to discover system and network basic commands, many of the services used on a server machine, as well as a few scripts that can be useful for SysAdmins on a daily basis.

### Docker

([Repository] () need to add on git)

## Piscines

In addition to the C Piscine used as a selection period, 42 occasionally offers 2 week intensives that act as introductory crash courses to other programming paradigms.

I haven't made it yet

## Exams

C exams are held once every week. These exams are electronically graded akin to the ones held by popular coding challenge websites. There are currently 2 levels: beginner and intermediate. The beginner exam focuses on fundamental C concepts, whereas the intermediate exam focuses more on algorithms. Passing an exam entails obtaining a high aggregate score (75+ for beginner, 84+ for intermediate) across multiple attempts. I solved all the intermediate exam problems and created an answer key [here](https://github.com/thaisavelino/ExamC-study)
