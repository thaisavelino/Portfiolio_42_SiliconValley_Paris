# Portfolio - Ã‰cole 42 (Paris and Silicon-Valley)

Projects made at School 42, a innovative learning school with no teacher..

42 is a computer educational center, the pedagogy is peer-to-peer learning : a participative process that allows students to unleash their creativity through project-based learning. The establishment was founded by Florian Bucher, Xavier Niel, Nicolas Sadirac and Kwame Yamgnane in 2013 while the digital industry is in full lack of IT developers in France. To train many of the best talents of tomorrow, the school provides the best infrastructure in a unique and modern place. 42, this is our answer to what should be the school of tomorrow.

Situated in the Bay Area USA [Silicon Valley](https://www.42.us.org/) and [Paris France](http://http://www.42.fr/).

## About the projects

Almost all projects are coded in **C language** on **macOS**.
All the projects are coded following a strict coding guideline (norm):

**A few norm highlights:**
* You can only use While loops
* max 25 lines per function *< 84 characters per line*
* max 4 arguments per function
* incredibly specific tabulation
* no memory leaks, no segmentation faults, no exceptions
* most importantly, **no use of C Standard Library functions** besides **(write, malloc, free, open, read)**, unless otherwise specified. So you must code your own Library.

# Projects List

These are the projects that I have completed during my time spent at 42, from April 2018 - until now.
There are repositories containing projects.

## Introduction

### C Piscine
1 month intensive selection program called the Piscine (French word for swimming pool), students that was selected bt an online test go to school and spend this 1 month where only the most rigorous and tenacious students are selected to enter the main program. The content is an introduction to Unix, C programming language and simple data structures.

([C Piscine Repository not Available])

### Libft
First project after starting the main program. We code **our own C library** that we will use for following projects besides of using the C Standard Library, to use for the rest of our projects. As we progress in the curriculum, new functions are constantly added to our personal libraries.

### Fillit
The goal of fillit is to implement a very specific algorithm that packs a list of teris tetrominoes (input) into the smallest square possible. Due to the nature of the rules, the only real solution is done through recursive backtracking.

### Get Next Line
  
  Recode getline from the C Standard Library. A true test of rigor.

## Algorithms Branch

  ### Printf
  
  Recode libc's printf function.

## DevOps Branch

  ### Init
  
  This project has the goal to discover system and network basic commands, many of the services used on a server machine, as well as a few scripts that can be useful for SysAdmins on a daily basis.

  ### Roger-skyline-1

  A project about VM creation, servers configuration and security.

  ### Docker-1
  Docker-1 project is to make you handle docker and docker-machine, the bases to understand 
  the idea of containerization of   services.

  [private Docker-1 Repository](https://github.com/thaisavelino/Docker-1-ecole42)

## Piscines

Like the C Piscine from selection period, 42 has 2 week intensive programs that act as introductory crash courses to other programming paradigms.

  ### Piscine PHP
  The PHP piscine allow us to access the basic technologies of the web like: HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript.
  Each day we get a new challange and we have to challenge the clock to deliver everything on time without losing any small detail.

## Exams

There are 2 currently levels: **beginner** (fundamental C concepts) and **intermediate** (algorithms). Check my solutions for the exam challanges [here](https://github.com/thaisavelino/ExamC-study)
